=== SKILL 1: Identify common shells
==== 1.1 Describe common shells and their differences
_What is a shell?_ - The most generic sense of the term shell means any program that users employ to type commands. A Unix shell is a command-line interpreter or shell that provides a traditional Unix-like command line user interface. A shell hides the details of the underlying operating system and manages the technical details of the operating system kernel interface, which is the lowest-level, or "inner-most" component of most operating systems. <<1>>

.*/bin/sh*
* Bourne shell, created by Stephen Bourne at Bell Labs in 1979.
* First widely popular (not first shell) distributed with Unix systems
* Often linked to /bin/bash or /bin/dash

.*/bin/csh*
* Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) Unix systems in 1978
* Created by Bill Joy as a student at UC Berkeley
* Uses syntax similar to C language, which was the dominant language at the time

.*/bin/tcsh*
* Fixed many of the bugs in csh and added numerous new features
* programmable command line completion & editing

.*/bin/bash*
* Created by the coming of the GNU project, aimed at building a POSIX compliant Unix-like system out of free software
* Officially released in 1988, writen by Brian Fox
* Most widely distributed Linux shell

.*/bin/dash*
* DASH (Debian Almquist shell), modern POSIX-compliant implementation of /bin/sh

.*/bin/ksh*
* Korn Shell. Backwards compatible with the Bourne Shell but includes some features of the  C Shell

.*/bin/zsh*
* Described as extended Bourne shell with features of bash, ksh, and tcsh

*Example of shell code differences between bash and tcsh*

 #!/bin/bash
 count=1
 for filename in $(ls /var/log)
 do
    echo "File $((count++)) is $filename"
 done

 #!/bin/tcsh

==== 1.2 Define common shell modes, features and functions

.*Bash – modes*
* $ - normal user prompt
* # - root prompt
* When bash is invoked with the name sh (old Bourne shell name), it will do its best to act like the original Bourne shell
* --posix – (posix mode) changes bash behavior to be POSIX compliant (information in bash man page)

Note that Linux is very different from Windows with wildcard (*) expanstion.
Linux expands the wildcard _before_ handing it off to the application.
In Windows, each application must deal with the wildcard itself.

This matters in some cases. The first 'ls' does not find all the matching files.

=== SKILL 2: Employ commands using common shells
==== 2.1 Demonstrate basic familiarity with the command line interface
.*DISCUSSION: What is Situational Awareness on a Linux System?*
* Command Order of Evaluation in Bash

It is important to understand when typing a command in the bash shell, how it
is evaluated and potentially executed. For example, an alias or fuction with
the same name of the intended command is evaluated before the command is parsed
and executed from the PATH. Because of this, it is possible to decieve the user
into executing commands other than the intended command.

REDIRECTION is attempted first +
ALIASES +
Parameter expansion, command substitution, arithmetic expansion, and quote removal before being assigned to the variable +
Shell FUNCTION +
BUILTIN command +
HASH table +
PATH variable ($PATH) +
If the above fails the the user receives the message “command not found” +

* Commands to Evaluate Bash Order of Evaluation
+
.*type*
----
type {command}     #evaluates bash order of evaluation to determine the first instance of the command
type -a {command}  #shows all instances of command in the order of bash evaluation
----
+
.*hash*
----
hash               #displays bash's hash table
hash -r            #clear (reset) bash's hash table
----
+
.*which*
----
which {command}    #evaluates the PATH in order and displays the first instance of the command if it exists
which -a {command} #evaluates the PATH in order and displays all instances of the command if it exists 
----
+
* General Commands
+
.*w*
----
w               #users logged on and what they are doing, uptime
----
+
.*man*
----
man             #manual help pages
----
+
.*find*
----
find --help     #file location
----
+
.*echo*
----
echo            #display a line of text on standard output
----
+
.*ls*
----
ls              #list directory contents
----
+
.*cat*
----
cat             #concatenates files and print on standard output
----
* What is running on the system
** Processes
+
--
.*ps*
[source, shell]
----
ps --help                   #view processes help
ps -ef                      #view processes
----

.*top*
[source, shell]
----
top                         #view updating process monitor, note that it shows memory usage
free                        #another method of showing memory usage
----
--
** Services
+
2 Main boot systems on Linux: SysV and systemd (there was upstart for a while, but it is mostly gone in favor of systemd)

- SysV
. inittab to check runlevel
. init.d scripts loaded out of RC# folders

- systemd
. services set to run at startup
. systemctl --help

** Scheduled Tasks
+
- cron - file per user located under /var/spool/cron/{username}
- crontab - system wide cron file /etc/crontab
- /etc/cron.{time} folders - pre-populated cronjobs to run scripts under folders (hourly, daily, weekly, monthly)
- at - one time scheduled job (atq to view)
+

* Users on the system?
** Accounts
+
/etc/passwd
+
** Groups
+
/etc/group
+

* Networking
** System networking settings
** Local Subnet
** Active network connections
** Routing
** Firewall settings
* Logging and auditing


==== 2.2 Describe environment initialization and implications <<3>>
|===
a|image::../../resources/images/linux_1_2.png[Bash Init Order,width=800,float="left"]
|===
* Login vs Non-login shell:
** login: First process spawned by /bin/login out of /etc/passwd file to execute under users id
*** typically represented in ps with '-' character
*** shell gained from text console, SSH, su -
*** Is not created during GUI login, you get a session manager or windows manager (ie, gdm3)
** non-login shell:
*** shell invoked from another shell
* Interactive vs Non-Interactive
** Interactive: reads commands from user input on a tty ($PS1 prompt variable is set)
** Non-Interactive: Shells running scripts, can run in background

==== 2.3 Demonstrate appropriate use of pipes and redirection
.*Standard Streams*
* STDIN: Standard input
** Input into a program, file descriptor 0
** Represented as 0< or < when redirecting standard input from a file
* STDOUT: Standard output
** Output of a program, file descriptor 1
** Represented as 1> or > when redirecting standard output to a file
* STDERR: Standard error
** Output of a programs error handler
** Represented as 2> when redirecting standard error to a file
* Use >> or 2>> to append rather than overwrite when redirecting
* Use 2>&1 when merging standard error into standard output

.*Pipes*
* Redirect output of one command to input of another command
* Unnamed pipe: |
** Uni-directional
** Opened at time of creation
* Named pipe / FIFO
** Created with mkfifo command or mknod p command
** Exist on filesystem with a name
** Can be accessed by unrelated processes
** bi-directional

.*DEMO: Named Pipe*
[source, bash]
----
#Terminal 1
cd /tmp
mkfifo inpipe
ls -la              #note inpipe shows up in the listing with a p
echo "All your base are belong to us" > inpipe &
jobs

#Terminal 2
cat < inpipe
----

* Also "mknod name p"

----
mknod pip p
cat < pip | tee pip
----

==== 2.4 Explain the fundamentals of Boolean logic
*DEMO: Create Truth Table*
[options=header]
|====
|A | B | AND | OR | XOR | NOT A 
|True|True|True|True|False|False
|True|False|False|True|True|
|False|True|False|True|True|True
|False|False|False|False|False|
|====

.*DEMO: Boolean in a shell*
** background operator
----
ping 127.0.0.1 &            #notice ping continues
----

* semi-colon
** Executes next command unconditionally
----
ping -c4 127.0.0.1 ; echo "All done"   #4 pings followed by the message 'All done'
----

* AND Operator (&&)
** Executes next command only if the previous command succeeds
----
cd /tmp && ls && echo "It works"            #cd to /tmp and run ls if successful
cd /fakedir && ls && echo "It works"        # attempt to cd to fake dir, nothing runs after
----

* OR Operator (||)
** Executes next command only if previous command fails
----
cd /tmp/fakedir || mkdir /tmp/fakedir       #first attempt creates, run again and it cd's
----

* NOT Operator (!)
** Inverts the logical value of the item
----
cd /tmp/fakedir
touch file1.txt file2.doc file3.pdf
ls *.pdf
ls !(*.pdf)
----

==== 2.5 Identify methods of gaining more information about commands and switches
** Manual for a command, automatically paged using 'more'
----
>man signal
>man -s 7 signal
----

** Find man pages using a keyword (two techniques)
----
>man -k ftp
>apropos ftp
ftp (1)              - Internet file transfer program
netrc (5)            - user configuration for ftp
sftp (1)             - secure file transfer program
sftp-server (8)      - SFTP server subsystem
(etc.)
----

** Find help, internal to the command (sometimes -h)
----
>ls --help
----

** Find a command
----
>which ls    #view filepath
/bin/ls

>whereis ls  #view filepath, finds all instances
ls: /bin/ls /usr/share/man/man1/ls.1.gz
----

** Find information about a file
----
>file /bin/ls
/bin/ls: ELF 64-bit LSB  executable, ...
----


=== SKILL 3: Analyze the Linux file system
==== 3.1 Describe file system hierarchy
Most Linux distrubutions follow the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS)
http://refspecs.linuxfoundation.org/FHS_3.0/fhs-3.0.html

image::https://git.cybbh.space/global-objects/resources/raw/master/file/facilitation-guides/linux/images/linux-filesystem.png[Linux File System,width=950,float="left"]

* file system types:
* ext3/4 - hard drive partitioning format
* tmpfs - temporary file storage
** Appears as a mounted volume, but is actually stored in volatile memory
** /var/run on older distributions, /run on new
* sysfs
** Pseudo file system providing information about kernel, hardware, device drivers
** Designed to add structure to the old procfs systems

.*mount - mount a filesystem*
----
mount -t type device dir
umount
----

.*df - Report file system disk space usage*
----
df -T
----

.*File System (main)*
----
/ - root
/bin – main user binaries
/sbin – main system binaries
/usr – progams, libraries, docs
/usr/bin – additional user binaries
/usr/sbin – additional system binaries
/lib – main libraries
/lib/modules – kernel modules
/usr/lib – additional libraries
/dev – files used to access devices
/etc – configuration files
/var – dynamic files (logs, package installs, etc)
/proc – pseudo file system for processes
/sys – pseudo file system for resources/hardware
/tmp – temp files clean on reboot
/opt – third party software
/mnt – mount point(s)
/root – root home directory
/home – user home directories
lost+found – files/directories that can’t be recovered
----

==== 3.2 Describe file system ownership properties
.*File Ownership*
* Each file object has an owner and a group
----
ls -la          #show owner:group
chown           #change owner
chgrp           #change group
chmod owner:group file
getent          #get entries from Name Service Switch libraries
----

----
user@host /etc $ ls -l passwd
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 2246 Feb  8 10:57 passwd
              ^    ^
            User  Group
----

.*File Properties*
----
- – regular file
d – directory
l – link
b – block special file
c – character special file
s – socket
p – named pipe (mknod, mkfifo)
----

* Extended permissions, especially +a (append-only) and +i (immutable)

----
chattr          # change extended permissions
lsattr          # list extended permissions
man chattr      # See ATTRIBUTES
----

==== 3.3 Discuss file system permissions
.*File Permissions*
* Each file has 12 bits describing its permissions
+
|===
a|image::../../resources/images/linux_1_3.png[File Attributes,width=600,float="left"]
|===

.*Two methods for using chmod*
----
touch somefile
ls -la
chmod 777 somefile
ls -la
chmod o-x somefile
ls -la
chmod -x somefile
ls -la
----

.*setuid and setgid bits*
* When these bits are set, the file will execute with under the context of owning user/group

* SUID, program set with SUID runs under the security context of the user (owner) of the program

* SGID, program set with SGID runs under the security context of the group of the program

* Sticky, when set on a directory only the owner of the file can delete or rename files in that directory

*DISCUSS: Why are setuid and setgid dangerous?*

.*DEMO: Find special bits*
----
find / -user root -perm 4000 -print 2>/dev/null
----

==== 3.4 Discuss file system timestamps
Available timestamps in Linux depend on the underlying format of the disk.

.*EXT3*
* mtime: modified time - time file was last modified
* atime: access time - time file was last accessed
* ctime: change time - time of inode record change

.EXT4*
* crtime: creation time

.*DEMO: EXT4 crtime*
----
ls -i somefile          #get inode for file
stat somefile           #view mac, inode, and other metadata about the file
debugfs -R 'stat <{inode#}>' /dev/sda1      #view inode field contents
istat /dev/sda1 {inode#}
----

.*Activities on a File*
* This chart pertains to the inode record for the file
[options=header]
|====
|FILE  |rename|local move|volume move|copy|access|modify|create|delete|perms
|mtime |      |          |     x     |    |      |  x   |   x  |  x   |
|atime |      |          |           |    |  x   |      |   x  |  x   |
|ctime |  x   |    x     |     x     |    |      |  x   |   x  |  x   |  x
|crtime|      |          |  dtime    |    |      |      |   x  |dtime |
|====
* on deletion an inode record will have a dtime added to the record to show when it was deleted
* on volume move, a new inode record is created on the new volume, mtime and atime are copied to new inode.  On old inode, mtime and ctime are updated, dtime is added.


.*Activities on Files in a DIR*
[options=header]

.*awk example*
Sample awk script, presidents.awk

All awk scripts are a sequence of /pattern/ {action} pairs.
BEGIN and END are executed once. All other blocks are executed for every input line.
----
BEGIN {
  previous = "None";
}

# Ignore the header line (just "State" at this point)
! /^State$/ {
  current = $0;    # $0 is the whole line, which is just a state
  if (current != previous) {
    if (count > 0) { print count, previous; }
    previous = current;
    count = 0;
  }
  count++;
  total++;
}

END {
  print count, previous;
  print total, "Total";
}

----

First 'awk' just extracts the State names.
Have to sort them to get all the state names grouped together.
Second 'awk' runs the awk script above to count state names.

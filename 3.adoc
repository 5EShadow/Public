== Faciliation:

==== Facilitation 6-8

=== *SKILL 6: Identify Linux processes*
==== 6.1 Identify common processes for Linux startup
* Linux Startup Processes

** Start init which is the parent/grandparent of all processes.  Its process ID is 1, 
and its parent is 0

** Modern Linux kernels/distros also have kthreadd which is a kernel thread daemon 
which is second after init so it will have a PID of 2 and will also have no parent. 
kthreadd manages hardware and is directly handled by the kernel (kernel mode) 
and have high priority.  They can be identified by the name enclosed in square brackets [].

** Mount filesystems defined in /etc/fstab

** Set system time from time stored in hardware (can also use an ntp service)

** Supported filesystems in:  /proc/filesystems

* DISCUSSION: Kernel vs user space
** Kernel shares single memory space
** Represented in ps list with []
** User space programs each have virtual memory allocation
** Services defined by the runlevel will be started.

==== 6.2 Identify common processes for Linux machine
* DEMO: Show a ps, point out /sbin/init and [kthreads]
* Identify which ones are normal or common: (command ps -ef)
** Which ones are user mode or kernel mode?

----

==== 6.3 Employ commands to enumerate processes
* Covered in basic shell commands
*ps command (current shell “ps”, whole system “ps aux”, forest “ps f”)

----
ps -ef              # SysV
ps -o "%cpu comm"

ps auxf             # forest view (BSD style)
ps axfo pid,ppid,comm
----

==== 6.4 Explain the functionality of daemons
* DISCUSSION: daemon is an orphaned process waiting for an event in the background.
** stdin, stdout and stderr are pointed to /dev/null

* Starting and stopping can vary depending on init system (i.e. systemd, openrc, sysv, etc).

** Usually works on all systems:

----
cd /etc/init.d/
./servicename start
./servicename restart
./servicename stop
----

** Some non-systemd systems:
----
service sevicename start/restart/stop
----

** systemd:
----
systemctl start/restart/stop servicename
----

* Service configuration files typically stored in /etc, do “man servicename” for more info (i.e. “man sshd”)

* DEMO: exec command

----
exec 3<>/dev/tcp/www.gentoo.org/80
echo -e "GET / HTTP/1.1\r\nhost: www.gentoo.org\r\nConnection: close\r\n\r\n" >&3
cat <&3
----

* DISCUSSION: Job control (jobs, fg, bg, ^z, kill %JID, &)

* at – one shot job
** reads a series of commands and executes them at a later time

** DEMO: at command

----
at now + 5 min          #enter at command prompt
echo Something          #throwaway command
atq                     #list current at queue
at -c <#>               #retrieve at command
----

* cron – recurring jobs

** Cron format:

----
* * * * * /directory/and/command
| | | | |
| | | | +---- Day of the Week   (range: 0-7, 1 = Monday)
| | | +------ Month of the Year (range: 1-12)
| | +-------- Day of the Month  (range: 1-31)
| +---------- Hour              (range: 0-23)
+------------ Minute            (range: 0-59)
# Sunday is 0 or 7
----

** Some crons use an extended cron which has Y after day of the week in the range of 1900-3000

** Resource: https://crontab.guru/

** Edit your own cron file (/var/spool/cron/crontabs)

----
crontab -e 			# opens user crontab in text editor
----

** System cron entries (ls -d /etc/cron*)

* Samba – suite of programs that allow interoperability with Windows Workgroups and Domains

==== 6.5 Discuss orphaned and defunct processes
* DISCUSSION: Difference between orphan and zombie
** Orphan: parent process exited, adopted by /sbin/init (so it's PPID becomes 1)
*** DEMO (see Appendix A)
** Zombie: process has exited, waiting on parent to acknowledge
*** Zombie can't be terminated with kill since it has already finished execution
*** DEMO (see Appendix B)

* Process States

----
D 	uninterruptible sleep (usually IO)
R 	running or runnable (on run queue)
S 	interruptible sleep (waiting for an event to complete)
T 	stopped, either by a job control signal or because it is being traced
W 	paging (not valid since the 2.6.xx kernel)
X 	dead (should never be seen)
Z 	defunct ("zombie") process, terminated but not reaped by its parent
----

** Additional characters may be displayed:

----
< 	high-priority (not nice to other users)
N 	low-priority (nice to other users)
L 	has pages locked into memory (for real-time and custom IO)
s 	is a session leader
l 	is multi-threaded (using CLONE_THREAD, like NPTL pthreads do)
+ 	is in the foreground process group
----

==== 6.6 Identify the purpose of apt/aptitude
* DISCUSSION: installs programs from repository

* Package management(Debian flavors)  Aptitude has a few other bells/whistles such as a text gui

** Search and install packages

----
apt-cache search text
apt-get install packagename
----

==== 6.7 Evalulate the validity of Linux processes
* DISCUSSION: process information under /proc

* Examine the validity of services

** Recognize unusual names – difficult

** Services/programs run from unusual directories

----
pwdx            # gets current working directory of process
ls -l /proc/PID/cwd

ps auxwwwe
ps -ef                  # get PID with:

ls -l /proc/PID/exe     # find the path and binary from where it was invoked
----

** Look at connection info and listening ports

----
netstat -anp  		# List all, don’t resolve port numbers, show program

=== *SKILL 8: Identify Linux networking features*
==== 8.1 Describe the local name resolution process on a Linux host
* DISCUSS: Order of precedence for DNS resolution
* DEMO: Show the following files and explain what they do:
----
/etc/hosts          # List of hosts and associated IP's
/etc/resolv.conf    # Name Server Settings
/etc/nsswitch.conf  # Determines lookup order

----

==== 8.2 Describe the difference between regular and raw sockets
* DISCUSS: Characteristics and permission requirements of a RAW SOCKET
* DISCUSS: When is a raw socket necessary (ie. nmap -sS)

A Unix domain socket or IPC socket (inter-process communication socket) is a data communications endpoint for exchanging data between processes executing on the same host operating system.

A network socket is an internal endpoint for sending or receiving data at a single node in a computer network. Concretely, it is an representation of this endpoint in the networking software (protocol stack), such as an entry in a table (listing communication protocol, destination, status, etc.), and is a form of system resource.

## upload and insert image for OSI model layers
image::https://git.cybbh.space/global-objects/resources/raw/master/images/cyber-branch-insignia-official.png[OSI Model Layers,width=128,float="left"]

Typical network socket format (IP:Port): 1.2.3.4:25

Non-raw socket – Protocol stack processes its respective layer, performing address, checksum (if applicable) validation, removes its respective header and trailer (if applicable) and passes up the contents to its immediate upper layer

RAW socket – no layer checking done, it is up to the application using the raw socket to interpret the data. RAW sockets are often used as packet capture/sniffer programs as it captures the “raw” data from the network interface card and passes it directly to the application

Network Services – not all inclusive, just a list of some

* ntpd – Network Time Protocol Daemon
* httpd (apache) – Hyper Text Transfer Protocol Daemon
* nginx – High-performance HTTP server, reverse proxy, and IMAP/POP3 proxy server
* sshd – Secure SHell Daemon
* postfix, sendmail – Mail Server Daemon
* snmpd – Simple Network Management Protocol Daemon
* iptables, nftables, ufw – Network Filtering Protocol Service
* nfsd – Network File System Server Daemon
* dnsmasq, nscd – Name Service Cache Daemon
* named (bind)– Dynamic Naming Service Server Daemon
* smbd (samba) –  Server Message Block Server Daemon

Network Super Servers (inetd and xinetd)

* Listen for network connection on behalf of another program

* Hands off control of that connection to intended server

* Help reduce memory load and improve security

* There are two different super servers:
**	inetd use TCP Wrappers to handle security
**	xinetd has builtin security features

*** Servers that normally use super server: telnet, FTP, TFTP, rlogin, finger, POP, IMAP

xinetd security configuration enhancements
----
Listen to only on network interface for the service:
	bind = <IP Address>
Accept connections only from IP addresses:
	only_from = <IP Addresses|Network>
Deny connections only from IP addresses:
	no_access = <IP Addresses|Network>
Set times during which users may access the server:
	access_times = hour:min-hour:min
If access is prohibited, send optional banner to  client:
	banner  = /usr/local/etc/deny_banner
----

# Example xinetd config file
----
service ftp
{
	socket_type	= stream
	protocol	= tcp
	wait		= no
	user		= ftp
	server		= /usr/sbin/in.ftpd
	server_args = -i
	disable		= no
}

Disable a service: change disable to yes
To restart the xinetd service:
	/etc/init.d/xinetd {restart|reload}
----

To run:
	Conserves resources
	Runs daemons only when needed
	Provides an additional layer of security and can turn virtually any script or program into a service

Not to run:
	Another vulnerable service
	Can secure services using other methods
	Can be used to create a backdoor listener

==== 8.6 Describe the advantages and disadvantages of Samba
* DISCUSSION: What is Samba
** Allows Windows file and printer sharing on Linux
* Advantages: free, uses CIFS
* Disadvantages: more overhead to configure
* A little challenging to get to work correctly for certain situations

Samba config file:
----
/etc/samba/smb.conf

Shares the /home/stuff directory as share.  Windows systems will see it as “share”, guest can access it, and nobody can write to it.

[share]
   comment = Shared Directory
   path = /home/stuff
   guest ok = yes
   writable = no
----

==== 8.7 Explain the functionality of telnet
* DISCUSSION: telnet features: basic authentication, plaintext

Program/protocol that allows remote console connectivity;  Clear text protocol, uses port 23 by default.

Can’t transfer a file natively, so why would you want to do this?  Sometimes the only access you have to a remote system is a standard terminal.

If you can, use ssh instead.

Netcat can transfer a file too!
